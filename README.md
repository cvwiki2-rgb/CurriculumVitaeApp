## How to run the app:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cvwiki2-rgb/CurriculumVitaeApp.git`
- Go to folder: `cd CurriculumVitaeApp`
- Install dependencies `npm i`

THEN

- Run development `npm run dev`

OR

- Run Storybook `npm run storybook`
- Deploy Storybook `npm run deploy-storybook`
- Run test `npm run test`
- Run build `npm run build`
- Run ESLint `npm run lint`

A _pre-commit_ Husky hook has been implemented that prevents pushing to the repository if there are any _ESLint_ errors in the application.
